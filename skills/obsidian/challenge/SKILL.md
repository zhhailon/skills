# Challenge — Push Back on My Thinking

Use the vault's own history to challenge current beliefs, surface contradictions, and pressure-test evolving ideas. This is not about being contrarian. It's about using the accumulated record of thinking to find where the cracks are.

**Scope:** the args passed to this skill (if empty, general; otherwise focused on the given topic)

Use the `obsidian` CLI (available in PATH) for all vault queries.

---

## Step 1: Identify What to Challenge

**If no topic provided:** Read the active context files and find everything marked `[evolving]`, `[hypothesis]`, or `[questioning]`:
```bash
obsidian read file="<Context File A>"
obsidian read file="<Context File B>"
obsidian read file="<Context File C>"
```

Also read the last 7-14 days of daily notes for currently active beliefs and positions:
```bash
obsidian daily:read
obsidian read path="Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md"
```

### Structured Belief Extraction
For each daily note and context file, extract beliefs explicitly. Look for statements containing:
- "I believe...", "I think...", "the issue is...", "what matters is..."
- "The way to...", "The problem with...", "What works is..."
- Strong assertions, confident predictions, or absolute statements

List these as raw statements before searching for contradictions. This prevents vague "the vault feels contradictory" analysis and forces specificity.

**If a topic is provided:** Search for all instances of that topic:
```bash
obsidian search query="<topic>"
obsidian search:context query="<topic>"
```

## Step 2: Find the Contradictions

For each current belief or position identified, search the vault for evidence that contradicts, complicates, or undermines it:

```bash
obsidian backlinks file="<note containing the belief>"
obsidian search:context query="<opposite or complicating concept>"
obsidian search query="<earlier version of this thinking>" path="Daily Notes"
```

Look for:
- **Self-contradictions**: Places where you wrote something that directly conflicts with a current belief
- **Abandoned positions**: Things that were once held strongly but quietly dropped. Why?
- **Unearned confidence**: Things marked `[solid]` that were never actually tested or proven
- **Wishful thinking**: Hypotheses that are treated as conclusions without evidence
- **Blind spots**: Important questions that are never asked. Adjacent topics that are never explored.
- **Stale thinking**: Positions that haven't been updated despite new information or experience

### Temporal Weighting
A belief contradicted 18 months ago has different weight than one contradicted last month.
- **Recent contradictions** (past 3 months): Active confusion. These need resolution now.
- **Medium-term contradictions** (3-12 months): May represent genuine evolution. Check if the old position was consciously abandoned or just forgotten.
- **Old contradictions** (12+ months): Likely represent growth, not confusion. Only flag if the old position was never explicitly updated.

Flag only active tensions. Don't surface ancient contradictions as current problems.

### Cross-Context Comparison
After individual file analysis, explicitly check: do different context files stake contradictory positions on the same topic? These cross-file tensions are often the most important because they indicate compartmentalized thinking, where something is true in one domain but denied in another.

```bash
obsidian search:context query="<belief statement>"  # search across ALL context files
```

## Step 3: Build the Challenges

For each challenge, structure it as:

### Challenge [#]: [Short title]

**Current position:** [What you currently believe, with citation to specific note/date]

**The problem:** [What contradicts, complicates, or undermines this]

**Evidence from the vault:** [Specific notes, dates, and quotes that create the tension]

**The question this raises:** [A genuine question, not rhetorical, that would need to be answered to resolve the tension]

**Severity:**
- **Crack**: Minor inconsistency, worth noting
- **Tension**: Real contradiction that needs addressing
- **Foundation risk**: If this is wrong, a lot of other thinking built on top of it is also wrong

## Step 4: Synthesize

### Patterns in the Challenges
What do the challenges have in common? Is there a meta-pattern (e.g., "Most of your evolving ideas haven't been tested against reality" or "You keep theorizing about X without talking to anyone who's done it")?

### The Hardest Question
What's the single most uncomfortable question the vault raises about current thinking? The one that would be easiest to avoid and most valuable to face.

### Recommended Actions
For each challenge, suggest one concrete action that would resolve the tension:
- A conversation to have
- An experiment to run
- A note to write that works through the contradiction
- A belief to update
- A question to sit with longer

## Output Guidelines
- Be honest, not harsh. The goal is clarity, not criticism.
- Always cite specific notes and dates. Vague challenges are useless.
- The best challenges are ones that make you think "I hadn't noticed that" not "that's unfair."
- Don't challenge things marked `[solid]` unless the vault genuinely contains contradicting evidence.
- This command should feel like talking to the most honest, well-informed version of yourself.
