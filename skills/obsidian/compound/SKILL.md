# Compound — Answer the Same Question Across Time to Show Context Compounding

Answer the same question three times: once with only the context available at an early point, once at a middle point, and once with today's full vault. The difference in answer quality demonstrates how accumulated context compounds over time.

**Usage:** `/compound [question]` -- e.g., `/compound How should I think about hiring?` or `/compound What's the right podcast format?`

---

## Step 0: Question Validation

Not every question benefits from this analysis. Before proceeding, classify the question:

**Good questions for /compound:**
- Questions where the answer depends on personal context (preferences, history, relationships, domain knowledge)
- Questions where more context would change the answer, not just lengthen it
- Questions about strategy, approach, or decision-making

**Bad questions for /compound:**
- Factual questions with stable answers ("What's our office address?")
- Questions where the answer is the same regardless of context
- Questions about topics the vault has barely touched

If the question is unsuitable, say so and suggest a better one. Don't force the exercise.

## Step 1: Map the Vault's Temporal Shape

Before selecting time periods, understand when context was actually accumulating.

### Daily Note Density
```bash
obsidian search query="" path="Daily Notes"  # get a list of all daily notes
```

Map the density: when did daily notes start? Are there gaps? When did writing become regular?

### Context File Timeline
```bash
obsidian read file="<Context File A>"
obsidian read file="<Context File B>"
obsidian read file="<Context File C>"
```

For each context file, note:
- Any internal date references (when was it created? when was it last meaningfully updated?)
- Confidence markers and their distribution (more `[solid]` markers suggest maturity)
- References to other notes (backlink density as a proxy for integration)

### Backlink Presence from Dated Notes
```bash
obsidian backlinks file="<context file>"  # which daily notes reference this?
```

This reveals when a context file became integrated into daily thinking vs. sitting as an isolated document.

### Multi-Signal Date Availability
Build a timeline using all available signals:
- Daily note dates (explicit)
- Internal date references in context files
- Modification dates on key notes
- First appearance of key topics in daily notes
- Creation dates of context files themselves

---

## Step 2: Select Three Time Periods

### Period Selection Criteria
Choose periods at inflection points where relevant context roughly doubled, not at fixed intervals. The question determines what counts as "relevant context."

For the given question:
1. **Search for relevant material:**
```bash
obsidian search query="<question topic>" path="Daily Notes"
obsidian search:context query="<question topic>"
obsidian search query="<synonym 1>"
obsidian search query="<synonym 2>"
```

2. **Map when relevant material accumulated:**
   - When did the first relevant note appear?
   - When did the relevant context file get created or start covering this topic?
   - When did daily notes start regularly touching this topic?

3. **Identify inflection points:**
   - **Period A (Early):** The vault's first real engagement with this topic. Minimal context.
   - **Period B (Middle):** A meaningful inflection, the point where an agent would have started giving noticeably better answers.
   - **Period C (Now):** Today. Full vault available.

If the vault doesn't have enough temporal depth on this topic, say so. Don't fabricate historical periods.

---

## Step 3: Context Inventory for Each Period

For each period, list exactly what an agent would have access to. Be exhaustive.

### Period A: [Date or date range]
**Available context:**
- Daily notes: [list which ones exist and are relevant]
- Context files: [which existed? what did they contain on this topic?]
- Essays: [any relevant ones?]
- Other notes: [anything else relevant?]
- **Total relevant data points:** [number]

### Period B: [Date or date range]
**Available context:**
- Daily notes: [expanded list]
- Context files: [what's new or changed since Period A?]
- Essays: [any new ones?]
- Other notes: [anything new?]
- **Total relevant data points:** [number]
- **What's new since Period A:** [specific additions]

### Period C: Now
**Available context:**
- [Full current inventory]
- **Total relevant data points:** [number]
- **What's new since Period B:** [specific additions]

---

## Step 4: Record Predictions

Before generating answers, the agent records its prediction:

> **Prediction:** Based on the context inventories above, I expect the answer quality to change in these specific ways between periods:
> - Period A to B: [predicted change]
> - Period B to C: [predicted change]
> - Biggest expected improvement dimension: [specificity / actionability / personal relevance / cross-domain connections]

This prevents confabulation. The prediction is checked against actual results in Step 6.

---

## Step 5: Generate Three Answers

### Constraints
1. **Hard context boundaries.** When writing the Period A answer, you may ONLY use information that existed at that time. No knowledge leakage from later periods. This is the hardest constraint and the most important one.
2. **Equal length.** All three answers should be approximately the same length (within 20%). This isolates quality from volume.
3. **Same voice.** All three answers should be written in the vault author's voice.
4. **Tag sources.** Each claim tagged with [VAULT: note, date] so leakage is verifiable.

### Period A Answer: [Date]
*Context available: [brief summary]*

[Answer using only Period A context]

### Period B Answer: [Date]
*Context available: [brief summary]*

[Answer using only Period A + B context]

### Period C Answer: Now
*Context available: [brief summary]*

[Answer using full vault]

---

## Step 6: Self-Verification

### Anachronism Check
Reread the Period A answer. Does it contain any knowledge, terminology, or perspectives that only appeared later? If yes, flag it and correct.

```bash
obsidian search query="<suspicious term from Period A answer>" path="Daily Notes"  # when did this term first appear?
```

### Prediction Check
Compare the actual answer differences against the predictions from Step 4. Where was the prediction right? Where was it wrong? What does the discrepancy reveal?

---

## Step 7: Compounding Scorecard

### Scoring Table

| Dimension | Period A | Period B | Period C | Compounding? |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Specificity** | /10 | /10 | /10 | Yes/No |
| **Actionability** | /10 | /10 | /10 | Yes/No |
| **Personal relevance** | /10 | /10 | /10 | Yes/No |
| **Cross-domain connections** | /10 | /10 | /10 | Yes/No |

Definitions:
- **Specificity**: Does the answer reference specific projects, people, decisions, or experiences? Or is it generic advice?
- **Actionability**: Could you act on this answer today? Or is it abstract?
- **Personal relevance**: Does the answer account for specific constraints, values, and context? Or could it apply to anyone?
- **Cross-domain connections**: Does the answer draw on multiple areas of the vault to produce a richer answer?

### Compounding Narrative
In 2-3 paragraphs: What changed between the answers? Where did the additional context produce the biggest improvement? Was the improvement gradual or did it jump at a specific inflection point?

### Null Result Handling
If the answers didn't meaningfully improve across periods, that's the finding. Possible reasons:
- The question isn't context-sensitive (any agent could answer it)
- The vault's relevant context didn't actually grow
- The context grew but in ways that don't affect this question

Don't force a compounding narrative if the data doesn't show it. Honest null results are more valuable than fabricated progress.

### The Compounding Rate
At the current rate of vault growth, estimate: how much better would the answer be in 6 months? What specific context additions would produce the biggest improvement?

---

## Anti-Patterns

**1. The Volume Illusion**
Making later answers longer and calling that improvement. Length is not quality. All three answers must be the same length.

**2. The Knowledge Leak**
Using information from Period C when writing Period A or B. This is the most common failure mode.

**3. The Forced Compounding**
Manufacturing improvement when the vault doesn't show it.

**4. The Generic Early Answer**
Making Period A deliberately vague or bad to make the improvement look more dramatic.

**5. The Summary Trap**
Turning the three answers into summaries of what the vault contains at each period, rather than genuine attempts to answer the question.

**6. The Cheerleader**
Celebrating every improvement uncritically. Some improvements are trivial. The scorecard should distinguish between meaningful and cosmetic improvements.

## Output Guidelines
- The three answers are the core of this command. They must be genuine attempts to answer the question, not demonstrations of what the vault contains.
- Equal length is a hard constraint. It prevents the lazy version where later answers are just longer.
- Knowledge leakage is the thing that ruins this exercise. Be vigilant about it.
- The null result is a valid finding. If compounding isn't happening for a topic, that's useful information about what the vault needs.
- Cite specific notes and dates in every answer. Traceability is what makes this exercise honest.
