# End-of-Day Processing

## Step 1: Read Today's Daily Note
Use the Obsidian CLI to read today's daily note:
```bash
obsidian daily:read
```

Parse everything captured: free-form writing, meeting notes, ideas, commitments, tasks mentioned, people referenced.

## Step 1.5: Structured Vault Connection Discovery

After reading today's note, run these specific queries every time:

### Required Queries
```bash
obsidian tags counts sort=count                         # what themes are most active right now?
obsidian search:context query="<theme 1 from today>"    # for each major topic in today's note
obsidian search:context query="<theme 2 from today>"
obsidian search:context query="<theme 3 from today>"
obsidian backlinks file="<notes referenced today>"       # what else connects to things you touched today
obsidian orphans                                         # any forgotten notes that relate to today's themes?
```

### Confidence Marker Detection
Check if today's writing shifted confidence level on anything:
- Read the relevant context files for topics discussed today
- Compare today's language with the confidence markers in those files
- Flag: "Yesterday you were `[hypothesis]` on X, today you sound `[solid]`" or "You wrote confidently about X today but the context file still has it as `[questioning]`"
- Suggest specific marker updates if warranted

### Contradiction Surfacing
Check if anything written today contradicts a previous entry:
```bash
obsidian search:context query="<strong claim from today>"  # find earlier mentions
```
- Does today's writing take a position that conflicts with something written last week?
- Did today resolve a previously open question, or create a new contradiction?
- Flag: "On [date] you wrote [X]. Today you wrote [Y]. These don't agree. Worth reconciling?"

### Connection Insights
Surface findings as: "Today you wrote about X. This connects to [[note]] from [date] where you were thinking about Y. Worth revisiting?" and "This is the third time [topic] has come up in the past two weeks."

## Step 2: Extract & Categorize

### Action Items
Pull out anything that looks like a task or commitment:
- Things promised to others
- Things to follow up on
- Deadlines mentioned

### Ideas & Insights
Capture any original thinking worth preserving:
- Observations about work patterns
- Ideas for projects, content, or experiments
- Realizations or shifts in perspective

### People & Commitments
Note any commitments made to or involving others:
- Follow-ups owed
- Meetings to schedule
- Messages to send

### Questions Raised
Capture open questions that emerged:
- Things to investigate
- Decisions pending
- Uncertainties to resolve

## Step 3: Suggest Filing Locations

For each extracted item, recommend where it should live:

| Item | Type | Suggested Location | Action |
|------|------|-------------------|--------|
| ... | Insight | [[Context File]] | Add to relevant section |
| ... | Task | Google Tasks | Create task with due date |
| ... | Idea | [[Related Note]] | Add to running log |

## Step 4: Suggest Backlinks

Use the Obsidian CLI to discover existing connections and verify note existence:
```bash
obsidian links file="[TODAY's DATE]"
obsidian backlinks file="[TODAY's DATE]"
obsidian search query="<person or project name>"
```

Identify terms in today's note that should link to existing notes:
- People mentioned -> link to their note if exists
- Projects mentioned -> link to project notes
- Concepts mentioned -> link to relevant context files

Present as: "Consider adding these backlinks: [[Person]], [[Project]], [[Concept]]"

## Step 5: Context File Updates

Flag if anything from today should update a context file:
- New belief or shift in thinking -> relevant context file's "What's shifted recently"
- New constraint discovered -> Constraints section
- Question resolved or new question raised -> Open Questions section
- Confidence level change -> Update the marker

Ask: "Should I update [context file] with [specific change]?" for each suggestion.

## Step 6: Carry Forward

### What to carry into tomorrow
Based on today's note, what should be top of mind tomorrow?
- Unfinished priorities
- Commitments due soon
- Momentum to maintain

### Quick Wrap Answers
If the Quick Wrap section wasn't filled in, draft answers based on the day's content:
1. Did I explore anything new today?
2. What did I actually move forward?
3. What bottleneck became obvious?
4. One thing to carry into tomorrow?
