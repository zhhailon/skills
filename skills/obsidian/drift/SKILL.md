# Drift — What Am I Avoiding?

Compare stated intentions against actual behavior over the past 30-60 days. Surface gaps between what you say matters and where time and energy actually go. Find what's being avoided.

Use the `obsidian` CLI (available in PATH) for all vault queries. If Google Calendar / Gmail MCP tools are available, use them for calendar and message review; otherwise, note the gap and proceed with vault-only analysis.

## Step 1: Gather Stated Intentions

Read context files for stated priorities, goals, and commitments:
```bash
obsidian read file="<Context File A>"
obsidian read file="<Context File B>"
obsidian read file="<Context File C>"
```

Extract:
- Stated priorities and goals
- Commitments made (to self and others)
- Things marked as important or urgent
- Open questions flagged for investigation
- Experiments proposed but not yet run
- Projects in "current" or "active" status

Also check daily notes for stated intentions:
```bash
obsidian daily:read
obsidian read path="Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md"  # past 30-60 days
```

Look for:
- "I need to..." / "I should..." / "I want to..." statements
- Carry-forward items from reflections
- Things mentioned as tomorrow's priority
- Recurring items that keep appearing

## Step 2: Gather Actual Behavior

### Calendar Analysis
Use Google Calendar to pull the past 30 days:
- Where did time actually go? (meeting types, projects, people)
- How much time was protected for deep work vs. consumed by meetings?
- Which projects got calendar time? Which got none?

### Tasks
Pull all tasks:
- What's overdue and by how long?
- What keeps getting pushed?
- What was completed vs. what sits?

### Daily Note Patterns
Across the past 30 days of daily notes:
- What topics come up repeatedly?
- What topics appear once and vanish?
- What gets energy (long writing, exclamation marks, ideas flowing)?
- What gets avoidance (mentioned briefly, no follow-through, "I should...")?

### Vault Activity
```bash
obsidian search query="<stated priority A>" path="Daily Notes"  # How often does this actually appear?
obsidian search query="<stated priority B>" path="Daily Notes"
obsidian backlinks file="<priority project note>"  # Is anything linking TO this?
```

For each stated priority, measure how much actual vault activity it generated.

## Step 3: Message Review

Review recent messages for commitment language: "I'll", "I'm going to", "let me", "will you", "did you", "following up", "I promised", "I owe you". This surfaces commitments without wading through casual messages.

Look for:
- Commitments made to others that haven't been fulfilled
- Conversations about projects that got no follow-through
- People you said you'd get back to

## Step 4: The Drift Report

### Alignment Score
For each stated priority, rate alignment between intention and action (1-10):

| Priority | Stated Importance | Actual Time/Energy | Alignment | Drift |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| ... | High | Low | 3/10 | Significant |

### What's Getting Attention It Wasn't Supposed To
Things consuming time that aren't in any priority list. Where is energy leaking?

### What's Being Avoided
The uncomfortable list. Things that are clearly important (stated in context files, mentioned repeatedly) but consistently get no action. For each:
- **What**: The thing being avoided
- **Evidence**: How many times mentioned vs. how much action taken
- **Possible why**: What might be driving the avoidance (fear, unclear next step, not actually important, too big, requires confrontation)
- **The cost**: What's the cost of continued avoidance?

#### Avoidance Decision Tree
For each avoided item, classify:
- **(a) Mentioned in past 7 days?** Yes = active avoidance. No = passive.
- **(b) Related items getting done?** If yes, then the avoidance isn't about capacity. It's specific avoidance of THIS thing. Dig into why.
- **(c) Has a clear next step?** If no, the avoidance may be about ambiguity, not resistance. Define one concrete action.
- **(d) Requires someone else?** If yes, the block may be relational, not motivational. Identify who and what the ask is.

### Commitments to Others
Promises made that haven't been kept. Overdue follow-ups. People waiting.

### Recurring Push Pattern
Tasks or intentions that appear, get pushed, appear again, get pushed again. The loop. For each:
- How many times has this cycled?
- What breaks the loop?

### The Honest Assessment
A direct, compassionate summary of where the drift is. Not judgmental. Just clear. "Here's what you said mattered. Here's what you actually did. Here's where they don't match."

### Recommended Corrections
For each significant drift:
- **Drop it**: If it keeps getting avoided, maybe it's not actually a priority. Remove it.
- **Do it now**: If it genuinely matters, schedule it in the next 48 hours.
- **Delegate it**: If it matters but you won't do it, who else can?
- **Reframe it**: If the next step is unclear, define one concrete action.

## Output Guidelines
- Be honest but not harsh. This is a mirror, not a critic.
- Always cite specific dates, notes, and data. Vague drift reports are useless.
- The most valuable insight is often the simplest: "You said X matters. You haven't touched it in 3 weeks."
- Don't confuse busyness with avoidance. Some things legitimately got deprioritized. The real drift is things that STILL matter but aren't getting attention.
- Distinguish between "dropped and should stay dropped" vs. "dropped and it's costing you."
